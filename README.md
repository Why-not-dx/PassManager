# PassManager

Runs with : Python 3

1 image "lock.png" included, need to update it if you want to add yours.

Uses pyperclip, tkinter, SQLite3

Project to create a data base linked to a basic GUI.
Not every command from the database module are used in the GUI yet.
It was not designed to be used as a proper important password manager as the database is not secured.
